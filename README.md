### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

During this project, I deepened my understanding of responsive design and semantic HTML. I learned how to use Flexbox to create layouts that adapt smoothly to different screen sizes. For example, I used the following CSS to center content both vertically and horizontally:

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  min-height: 100vh;
}
```

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to continue focusing on:

- Improving my understanding of advanced Flexbox and CSS Grid layouts for more complex responsive designs.
- Enhancing accessibility by following best practices for semantic HTML and ARIA roles.
- Refining my use of CSS custom properties for better theme management and maintainability.
- Exploring more efficient ways to structure and organize CSS for scalability.
- Perfecting my workflow with version control and deployment tools.
